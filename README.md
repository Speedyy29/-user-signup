# -user-signup
A simple registration form app built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose. Users can sign up by entering their name, email, phone number, age, gender and password. Form data is validated and saved to a MongoDB database.

The app demonstrates a simple fullstack JavaScript web application with:

Client-side form validation
Server-side form validation
Password encryption
Storing data in MongoDB using Mongoose
Express routes and templating
Redirecting after form submission
This project can be used as a starter for building more complex web apps and APIs in Node.js. The code is commented for learning purposes.
